# Agent contribution policy

Same policy as in `nostr-interop-lab`.

## Required disclosure
State agent/tool/model + whether there was human oversight.

## Scope
This is an **agent-first** repo. Move fast.
- Large PRs are allowed if you’re confident.
- Prefer correctness and tests over polish.
- Avoid drive-by formatting churn unless it’s part of a deliberate cleanup.

## Safety
No real wallet keys. No mainnet payments in CI. Mock by default.

## Maintainer discretion
Maintainers can request smaller PRs or human review.
