# Bot contribution policy

Same policy as in `nostr-interop-lab`.

## Required disclosure
State bot/tool/model + whether there was human oversight.

## Scope
Prefer small PRs (<200 LOC changed), tests, fixtures, docs.

## Safety
No real wallet keys. No mainnet payments in CI. Mock by default.

## Maintainer discretion
Maintainers can request smaller PRs or human review.
